# Guess The Word Game (Hangman-style)

This is a simple "Guess The Word" game built using Flutter and state management with the `provider` package. The game is similar to the classic Hangman-style game, where players need to guess the letters of a hidden word. Players are given six attempts to guess the wrong letters before the game ends.

## Features
- Displays the word with guessed letters and underscores.
- Tracks wrong guesses and limits the number of wrong attempts to 6.
- Displays a keyboard with all letters of the alphabet.
- The player can guess one letter at a time.
- Shows a message when the game is over (win or loss).
- Option to play again after finishing a game.

## Requirements
- Flutter 2.0 or higher
- Dart 2.12 or higher
